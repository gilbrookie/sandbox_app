Sandbox_app
===========

This project is really just a sandbox of things/ideas I'm working on or am interested in.


Overview
---------

Essentially this app is a Flask website that connects to a SQLite database and also has a
command line interface to the backend (because I like using a terminal).

Roadmap
-------

1. Get the Basics up and running
    1. Implement all views
    2. Update the database schema (fix entries table deficiencies, add user table)
    3. Implement basic cli app.
2. Movie to a proper database abstraction system (sqlalchemy or other)
3. Figure out bcrypt for storing user paswords and provide proper access restrictions
4. Support https
